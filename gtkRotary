<p>If you want a video, you should show the YouTube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckk5PZ1ZSck  This video is mainly from the International Space Station (ISS) which is circling the earth every 90 minutes.  When you start introducing me, you can say that Vackachan worked for the NASA communication network in order to bring this type of video and data from the ISS.  Vackachan worked for various NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) projects at the Goddard Space Flight Center for 45 years as an engineer.  He started on January 22, 1973 as a junior software engineer designing and implementing data communications systems for NASA’s Spacecraft and Tracking and Data Networks.  He retired in January, 2019 while he was working as a chief engineer for NASA. He has received numerous awards and recognition for his work at NASA.  
<p>Vackachan completed his pre-University from St. Joseph college Tiruchirappalli at the age of 16 with a first class and distinction plus in mathematics.
<p>In 1965 he came to US with the help of his uncle Varkeychen, he got admitted to University of Maryland to study Electrical Engineering.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1969.  After graduation, he continued his education as a graduate student in Electrical Engineering for another two years while working as a research/teaching assistant.  He returned to India in September, 1971.  Since he could not get any job in India, he returned back to the US in 1972. 
<p>I will ask Vackachan for a brief description of his work at NASA as an engineer for 45 years.
<p> will respond as follows:

<p>As Siny said, I started working for NASA on January 22, 1973. 
<p>Now I am going to talk in Malayalam since I still do arithmetic in Malayalam.  
<p>When I went to school in Kerala in the old days, I had to learn multiplication table for 16.  Since people dealing with computers use hexadecimal number system to represent numbers, knowing multiplication table of 16 makes it easier for handling hexadecimal numbers.  The hexadecimal number system is based on 16.  
<p>I started my job as a junior software engineer.  
<p>I worked for the design and implementation of data communications systems for the NASA’s worldwide Spacecraft Tracking and Data Network (STDN).    
<p>My work was in the real-time software design.  
<p>When I started my work at NASA, we needed to develop all the software running on the computer including the operating system.  
<p>The hardware engineers working in my group designed the data communication hardware.
<p>The software engineers designed and implemented all the software including the operating system  
<p>The computers used for this job came with no software or hardware required for communication.
<p>The computers did not have any display devices.  
<p>The input/output with these computers used teletype.  
<p>
<p>NASA currently operates two networks: one for low earth orbit satellites and one for deep space satellites.  
<p>The deep space network requires only a maximum of three ground stations since at least one of them will have line of sight communication with a spacecraft going far away from earth.  
<p>But low earth orbiting satellites like many of the early manned missions circling the earth require multiple tracking stations spread around the world.  
<p>This is because a low earth orbiting satellite can be seen from a tracking station only for about three minutes.  
<p>I worked for the STDN network with over twenty tracking stations spread around the world for support of the low earth orbiting satellites.  
<p>I worked in a NASA branch called the Network Computing Branch which was responsible for all software and hardware used in a ground station.  
<p>Most of these computers were Univac made by Rand corporation.  
<p>These computers were the size of two refrigerators and had lots of lights including a big siren with a big red flashing light that went off when the computer crashed or overheated.  
<p>The cell phone you have now, probably is thousand times more powerful than these computers.  
<p>The computer had no display screen.  
<p>The input/output from these computers were teletype.  
<p>We programmed them using assembly language or machine language.  
<p>The applications including the operating system had to be developed in-house.  In other words, these computers did not come with any software.
<p>Now you should ask me about the first NASA award that I received.
<p>I will respond as follows:
<p>One of the first jobs where I had a major role was for the development of a real-time simulator to simulate the telemetry and command system for the Apollo spacecraft.  
<p>This simulator was to be used to prepare the ground stations that were going to be supporting the Apollo-Soyuz project that was done in July, 1975.  
<p>Normally the spacecraft simulator runs on a computer that is installed in a NASA plane.
<p>For the Apollo-Soyuz mission, NASA decided to build a real-time spacecraft simulator that could be transported easily to the ground station and do the spacecraft simulation without the use of the plane.  
<p>This system was called a portable spacecraft simulator running on a Rolm computer.  Although this system was called portable, this system weighed about 70 lbs.  It was called portable mainly because it could be sent on a commercial flight.
<p>This computer was a ruggedized version of a computer made by Data General.  
<p>In the old days, NASA had computers made by lots of different companies with different hardware and instruction architecture.  These days, most of the computers runs with Intel instruction set.
<p>When they needed to test the ground stations including the antennas, they had to use the system in the plane.  
<p>Everything else could be tested using the system running on the Rolm computer.
<p>NASA decided to test the Orroral Valley, Canberra, Australia using the portable simulator.  
<p>Since this system was too new, they asked me to go to Australia for the testing.  From Australia, I was supposed to go to Santiago, Chile with a one week stay at Tahiti.  But when we were in Australia, NASA decided to send the plane with the simulator.  
<p>Then one of my co-workers and I changed the airline ticket so that we could stay in Fiji for a day on our way back to the US.  
<p>But the Fiji government did not let me in because my Indian passport did not list Fiji as one of the countries I could visit.  Therefore, we took the next flight from Fiji to Honolulu and stayed there for a day for sightseeing.  
<p>When I came back from Australia, my manager asked me to go to Madagascar to test the ground station there.    Since my wife was new in the US and she did not want to be without me for another week, I did not go.  
<p>For the development of the spacecraft simulators and testing the ground system, NASA gave a Group Achievement award to the Apollo-Soyuz simulation team.  This is the first award I got from NASA.
<p>Immediately after the Apollo-Soyuz simulation project, NASA asked me whether I could develop software to do a real-time simulator that could be used to train the operators in the ground to control the nutation of a spacecraft.  
<p>NASA had never done a real-time simulator by using digital technique to do this type of system.  
<p>In order to do this, one had to solve differential equations in real-time.  
<p>After some analysis work, I told NASA it can be done.  
<p>I successfully built such a simulator by solving the differential equations in real-time that had to produce the next value of the nutation waveform in a few milliseconds.
<p>This problem was difficult for a small computer since the computers in those days had too little power.  
<p>The software I developed had to be very efficient for this system to work properly.  
<p>This system was successfully used to train the ground personnel.  
<p>I was able to do this software because, when I was in Electrical Engineering, I took a math/computer science course called “Numerical Analysis” that taught me how to solve differential equations on a computer.  
<p>A number of people in NASA management took a note of my accomplishment and it was good for career advancement with promotion and salary increase.
<p>Then you can ask me about the Silver Snoopy award given by the astronaut.
<p>I will respond to as follows:
<p>After working with spacecraft simulators and some aspects of data communications between ground stations and control centers, I was very well versed in various spacecraft command/telemetry systems and NASA communication protocols called NASCOM protocols.  
<p>Just like the Internet now uses IP, NASA used its own protocol called NASCOM protocols.  
<p>The NASA communications network was developed much before the development of the Internet. 
<p>In the early days and a number years after I started working for NASA projects, all data and voice communication came through Goddard Space Flight center.  
<p>In order to eliminate the need for having a large number of ground stations around the world, NASA decided to use geosynchronous communication satellites to support communications between low earth orbiting satellites and control centers.  
<p>In order to properly manage and operate such a network, NASA needed a Network Control Center (NCC).  
<p>I worked in the design and implementation of the software required for the NCC.  
<p>I worked for NCC for a number of years.  
<p>I was awarded a Silver Snoopy astronauts personal award for the NCC work.  
<p>The photograph shows me receiving this award from the NASA astronaut Bryon O’Connor.  
<p>The other person in the photo looking at the award presentation is the then director of Goddard Space Flight Center, Dr. Noel Hinners.  
<p>In addition to this Silver Snoopy award, I was given a plaque that contains an American flag and the TDRS patch that was taken on the Space Shuttle Challenger that took the first TDRS communication satellite.  The picture shows this flag and patch.  
<p>Then you ask about the award that I got for the technical excellence and dedication for the completion of NASA’s first automatic guard processor that was accredited for operations.
<p>The NASA network spanned across the globe to connect to tracking stations that was in various parts of the globe.  
<p>With the introduction of the TDRS, the network now extends those communication satellites orbiting at a height of about 35,000 kilometers.  
<p>This network is very tightly controlled and has no connection to any other network like the current day insecure Internet.  
<p>Still, NASA wants to monitor the traffic coming to the Network Control Center to make sure no malicious actors sent malicious traffic on this network.  
<p>Therefore, NASA decided to build a system to carefully examine traffic coming and going to/from NCC.  
<p>This system is similar to a firewall that organizations now put on their connections to the Internet.  
<p>Note that there was no Internet when NASA was designing this type of system to protect their network.  
<p>NASA spent quite a bit of money for the design and development of this system.  
<p>But when this system was put into operation, the system was dead most of the time and the people who initially designed and implemented this system could not get it working properly.  
<p>I was then put on this project to resolve the problem with this system.  
<p>I was able to resolve the problems with this system and get it running again properly.   A
<p>NASA award was given to me on December 12, 1986 for making this first of a kind system accredited for operations for NASA.  
<p>As an engineer, I have been mainly interested in designing and implementing new systems.  But in the later years of my career, I have been put into situations where I had to fix broken systems and make it operational.  From my experience, you get more accolades, recognition and reward for resolving problems with a system than designing and implementing a system.
<p>Then you can ask me about my inventions and contribution award that I received in August 2, 1999.
<p>The “Inventions and Contribution Award” was for the development of a “Data Distribution System” for NASA that allowed scientists and researchers from around the world to browse and select their data products of their interest and get it distributed through the “Space Physics Analysis Network” or create CDs with the data users selected.  
<p>This was done before the prevalence of this type of system on the Internet.  
<p>The “Space Physics Analysis Network” was similar to the current Internet.  
<p>It connected various Universities and research institutions around the world.  This network existed much before the current Internet.  It did not run IP.   
<p>It ran a proprietary protocol called DecNet developed by now defunct Digital Equipment Corporation.  
<p>As Internet Protocol was developing, the IP capability was added to this system so that users with IP could also use the capabilities of this system.  
<p>The award was given because we developed it much before the prevalence of this type of system on the Internet like Amazon.  
<p>This system had many features of an e-commerce system except the payment part since NASA data is free to the public.

<p>Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour are the Space Shuttles. 
<p>Enterprise is never flown in space.  It has no engines.  It was built to test the landing.  When the shuttle lands it does not use the engine.  It was built by Rockwell in California.  When it was unveiled, I got to see it at the Rockwell plant.  I was in California Edwards Air Force Base at that time to prepare the ground station used for the approach landing test where the space shuttle is put on top of a Boeing 747 and released.  This air force base has a very long runway for this kind of test.
<p>Columbia was first flown on April 12, 1981.   
<p>I went with my family to Kennedy Space Center in Florida to view the launch of Challenger on June 18, 1983 with the first American woman in space.   
<p>The last launch of the shuttle was on July 8, 2011. I had a NASA pass to see this last launch.  I had to cancel this trip to Florida the last minute.  
<p>Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986.    Columbia lost during reentry on February 1, 2003.  
<p>Atlantis sits in the Kennedy Space Center visitor center. 
<p>Endeavour is in California.  Discovery is in the Air and Space Museum in Virginia.  
<p>Enterprise is in the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City.
<p>The idea of the Space Shuttle was to build a reusable space vehicle that could land like a plane and thus reduce the cost.  
<p>The reduction of cost did not materialize.   
<p>The cost of an expendable launch system was lower than the so-called reusable Shuttle.  
<p>Because of cost and safety issues, the program was cancelled.  It was nice to see it take off and land.
<p>The new launch vehicle for the US is designed and built by SpaceX and Boeing.  
<p>There is also a new launch system designed by private contractors with heavy involvement of NASA.  This is called the Space Launch System (SLS).  This project is also late and has cost overrun.  The US Senate completely supports this project since the work for this project is spread around the country and they like to keep their constituent employed.
<p>Vackachan completed his pre-University from St. Joseph college Tiruchirappalli at the age of 16 with a first class and distinction plus in mathematics.  In 1965 he came to US with the help of his uncle Varkeychen, he got admitted to University of Maryland to study Electrical Engineering.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1969.  After graduation, he continued his education as a graduate student in Electrical Engineering for another two years while working as a research/teaching assistant.  He returned to India in September, 1971.  Since he could not get any job in India, he returned back to the US in 1972.  He started working at Goddard Space Flight Center in January 22, 1973 as a junior engineer.  He retired from work in January, 2018 while he was a chief engineer at NASA.  While working for NASA, he has received many awards and recognition.  I will ask Vackachan for a brief description of his work at NASA.
<p>The four years of education as an undergraduate and two years as graduate student in Electrical Engineering at Maryland from 1965 to 1971 well prepared me to work at NASA as an engineer.
